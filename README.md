<h1>README.md</h1>

<p>This is a basic fun project to help build my foundamentals in Vanilla Javascript.</p>
<p>This project has full crud without the use of a backend because I used localStorage to save the instances that have been
deleted from the list (when the page refreshes).</p>
<h3>CRUD</h3>
<p>The create is making a new instance and adding it onto the list</p>
<p>The read is looking at all the instances that the user has inputted into the list.</p>
<p>The update is the filter to check the items that have been bought and the items that have not been bought.</p>
<p>The delete is deleting an instance off the list.</p>

<h3>Add-Ons: </h3>
<p>By using localStorage, I was able to turn this fun project into a Single Page Application (S.P.A). Everytime a user would have to turn off his/her phone, the application should reset and all their data is gone. That would be inconvenient, having to re-input all the items you
have to buy and you might end up forgetting one or two things if the list is long. localStorage would actually help prevent that event,
because it will save the user's info. </p>

<h4>Scalability: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>I would love to add a progress bar, to make the tracker seem like a game for the users. It will make an errand less tedious and more enjoyable.</li>
    <li>I would also love to make it into a responsive app, if we change the size of the screen into an iphone X. There is some content
    missing and for an app to be viable, it has to become responsive. It works sideways, but when I go shopping with a list, the list is generally verticle on my phone.</li>
    <li>I would like to create a history for the user. The history will be part of the backend data of all the list he/she made. This
    would help the user plan better and to help clarify if they need to buy the same item soon. It will contain a delete to take the list off forever and a repeat list.</li>
